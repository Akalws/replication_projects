## Case Study 9: Interacting with time

### Background

Your data science income has ballooned and you need to find somewhere to invest your $25,000 you saved over the last year. You have a savvy investment friend who is kind enough to tell you ten stocks he has been watching in the previous year. You will need to visualize the last five years' performance to support the conversation with your friend.

### Tasks

[ ] For your coding development use these tickers - `tikcers_use = ["CXW", "F", "GM", "JCP", "KR", "WDC", "NKE","T", "WDAY", "WFC", "WMT"]`
[ ] Use
[ ] Use library(dygraphs) to build interactive visualizations of the stock performances over the last 5 years.
[ ] Make a library(ggplot2) graphic that helps you build a solid question around how an investor would use volume in their trading strategy
[ ] Create an .Rmd file with 1-2 paragraphs summarizing your graphics and the choices you made in your visualization
[ ] Compile your .md and .html file into your git repository
[ ] Find two other studentâ€™s compiled files in their repository and provide feedback using the issues feature in GitHub (If they already have three issues find a different student to critique)
[ ] Address 1-2 of the issues posted on your project and push the updates to GitHub
[ ] Publish your case study to Rstudio Connect at shiny.byui.edu
